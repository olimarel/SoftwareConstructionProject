We already have a design pattern in the project, a observer design pattern.

	The list (refreshments) in the Menu class in package vinnsla is an ObservableList so
	it is what is observed, i.e. it is observable. And then in the Basket class in the same
	package we have, in the constructor of that class, a listener that is an observer and it
	observes the list in Menu, i.e. it observes and knows everything in the list, refreshments.
	If an extra refreshment were to be added to the list in Menu, then the listener (observer)
	observes it (i.e. knows it has been added). So there a observer design pattern has already
	been implemented so there is no need to add anything else in.
